Anagrams Lab  
An anagram is a new word formed by rearraging the letters of another word and using the letters exactly once.  
Write a program that:  
- asks the user for two separate inputs.
- Check if the entered inputs are anagrams.
- If the inputs are anagrams, return True from the provided function.
- If the inputs are not anagrams, return Fale from the provided function.

Notes  
-Empty strings are not anagrams  
-Case does not matter  
-Spaces should not be taken into account

For example:  
Input  
angel  
glean  

Return  
True  

Input  
Hello  
World  

Return  
False
